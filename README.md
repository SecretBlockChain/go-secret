## About Secret

Secret is committed to solving the problems of existing blockchain solutions such as low transaction processing speeds, very expensive and limited computing resources and capacity. Secret proposes a blockchain solution suitable for large-scale transactions and calculations, with high performance, high security, and flexible expansion.

Secret core features include:
1. Original POE (Proof of Equality) consensus mechanism
With high-performance transaction processing capabilities (average TPS 4500+) and low-consumption performance, the POE consensus mechanism provides everyone with the same opportunity to participate, truly breaking the monopoly of blockchain computing power.
2. The built-in decentralized computing power network brings verifiable and unlimited computing power to the blockchain. Smart contracts make it possible to implement large-scale matrix multiplications, AI model training and 3D rendering, to enable more real-world commercial applications and achieve computing goals.
3. The chain state synchronization function can effectively, solve the problems of the continuous expansion of block data, and greatly reduce the participation threshold of Secret nodes, to truly allow everyone to participate in blockchain and benefit from it.

The Secret ecosystem is a framework that consists of three technical layers: the data persistence layer, the domain layer and the service layer. The data persistence layer has an account system, a POE consensus mechanism, and smart contracts. The domain layer consists of a cross-chain protocol suite based on smart contracts, a distributed computing system, and a data mapping and storage protocol suite. Finally, the service layer of the
plaborm consists of a complete third-party protocol, API and SDK, a dashboard and related components. The service layer also provides access to developers and other related parties, realizing the processes of information generation, consumption, and delivery of the entire ecosystem.
